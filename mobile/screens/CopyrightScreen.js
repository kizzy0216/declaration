          What Is copyright infringement?
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Copyright infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is
          reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly displayed, or made
          into a derivative work without the permission of the copyright
          owner. Posting copyright-infringing content can lead to the
          termination of your account, and possibly monetary damages if a
          copyright owner decides to take legal action.

          How do I make sure my content does not infringe someone elseâ€™s
          copyrights?
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          The best way to ensure that your content doesn't infringe someone
          else's copyright is to be sure that all components of your content
          are your original creation. For example, if you use an audio track of
          a sound recording owned by a record label without that record label's
          permission, your content may be infringing the copyrights of others, and
          may be subject to removal.
