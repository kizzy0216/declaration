          <p>
            For some activities on Declaration, like uploading content or
            contacting members, you need a Declaration Account. We ask for some
            personal information when you create an account, including your
            email address, which is used to protect your account from
            unauthorized access.

            Usage information
          </h2>
          <p>
            When you use Declaration, we may record information
            about your usage of the site, such as the channels, groups and
            favorites you subscribe to, which other users you communicate with,
            the members you follow, the frequency and size of data transfers, and
            information you display about yourself as well as information you
            click on in Declaration (including UI elements, settings). If you are
            logged in, we may associate that information with your Declaration
            Account. In order to ensure the quality of our service to you, we may
            place a tag (also called a "web beacon") in HTML-based customer
            support emails or other communications with you in order to confirm
            delivery.

            Content uploaded to the platform
          </h2>
          <p>
            Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose
            online (e.g., your profile page) may be collected and used by
            others.

            Uses
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you submit personal information to Declaration, we may use that
            information to operate, maintain, and improve the features and
            functionality of Declaration, and to process any flagging activity
            or other communication you send to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not use your email address or other personal information to
            send commercial or marketing messages without your consent. We may
            use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or
            administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Declaration
            changes or for customer service purposes). You also can choose how
            often Declaration sends you email updates in your Declaration Account
            settings page.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store
            information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your
            visit or the next time you visit Declaration; (b) provide custom,
            personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness
            of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as
            total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your
            entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and
            contests.

          <h2>
            Information that is publicly available
          </h2>
          <p>
            When you create a DeclarationAccount, some information about your
            Declaration Account and your account activity will be provided to
            other users of Declaration. This may include the date you opened your
            Declaration Account, the date you last logged into your Declaration
            Account, your age (if you choose to make it public), the country
            where you reside and the number of pages you have viewed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Declaration Account name, not your email address, is displayed
            to other users when you engage in certain activities on Declaration,
            such as when you upload content or send messages through Declaration.
            Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment on the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any content that you submit to Declaration may be redistributed
            through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by
            other Declaration users or the general public.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may also choose to add personal information which may include
            your name, gender, profile picture or other details, that will be
            visible to other users on your Declaration Account channel page. If
            you choose to add certain features to your Declaration Account
            channel page, then these features and your activity associated with
            these features will be displayed to other users and may be aggregated
            and shared with your friends or other users. Such shared activity may
            include your favorite content and content that you have uploaded.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Your choices
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you have a Declaration Account, you may update or
            correct your personal profile information, email preferences and
            privacy settings at any time by visiting your account profile page.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may control the information that is available to other users and
            your confirmed connections at any time by editing your Declaration
            Account and the features that are included on your profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may, of course, decline to submit personal information through
            Declaration, in which case you can still explore Declaration, but
            Declaration may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some
            advanced Declaration services may use outside parties. The privacy
            notices of those services govern the use of your personal information
            associated with them.

            operating system) to provide you with relevant advertising. If you

            Declaration's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control
            the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Any data
            obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with
